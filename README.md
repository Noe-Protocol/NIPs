# Noe Improvement Proposals (NIPs)

This repository contains the **Noe Improvement Proposals** (NIPs), the formal mechanism for proposing changes, extensions, and enhancements to the Noe Protocol.

**Noe** is a symbolic communication substrate designed to make thought interoperable, across humans, machines, and hybrid systems. The NIP process ensures that changes to this protocol are transparent, peer-reviewed, and technically rigorous.

## What is a NIP?

A **Noe Improvement Proposal** (NIP) is a design document that specifies a new feature, rule, glyph, grammar structure, or process within the Noe ecosystem. NIPs are intended to:

- Document protocol evolution  
- Standardize symbol usage and structure  
- Enable parser and agent interoperability  
- Formalize decisions in a public, versioned archive

See [`nip-0001.md`](.NIPs/nip-0001.md) for the full NIP lifecycle and contribution process.

## Directory Structure

Each NIP is a standalone Markdown file in the NIPs/ directory.

[/nip-0001.md](.NIPs/nip-0001.md)     – NIP process and lifecycle definition

NIPs follow the naming convention `nip-XXXX.md`. Numbers are assigned after review and merge.

- `Proposed`: Accepted for future inclusion

## How to Contribute

Anyone can propose a NIP:

1. Fork this repository  
2. Create your proposal in Markdown  
3. Follow the format outlined in `nip-0001.md`  
4. Submit a pull request titled `NIP: <your title>`

NIP editors will review, assign a number, and provide feedback.

## Governance

The NIP process is currently maintained by the founding author [`@augustus`](https://github.com/augustus-aligned) and early contributors.

- **Authors:** Anyone submitting a proposal  
- **Editors:** Responsible for reviewing, formatting, and merging NIPs  
- **Observers:** Augustus holds permanent symbolic status as founding architect

This structure may evolve as the protocol matures.
