# Noe Improvement Proposals (NIPs)

This repository contains the **Noe Improvement Proposals** (NIPs), the formal mechanism for proposing changes, extensions, and enhancements to the Noe Protocol.

**Noe** is a symbolic communication substrate designed to make thought interoperable across humans, machines, and hybrid systems. The NIP process ensures that changes to this protocol are transparent, peer-reviewed, and technically rigorous.

<br>

## Motivation

Symbolic systems require a structured improvement process to prevent semantic drift and ensure consistent interpretation across implementations.  The NIP framework maintains deterministic interoperability between human and machine parsers, preserves historical traceability of meaning, and enables transparent governance of Noe’s symbolic ontology.

<br>

## What is a NIP?

A **Noe Improvement Proposal** (NIP) is a design document that specifies a new feature, rule, glyph, grammar structure, or process within the Noe ecosystem.  

NIPs are intended to:

- Document protocol evolution  
- Standardize symbol usage and structure  
- Enable parser and agent interoperability  
- Formalize decisions in a public, versioned archive  

Each NIP serves as both a technical and symbolic record of how Noe evolves as a shared cognitive protocol.

See [`nip-0001.md`](.NIPs/nip-0001.md) for the full NIP lifecycle and contribution process.

## Directory Structure

Each NIP is a standalone Markdown file in the `NIPs/` directory.

[`/nip-0001.md`](.NIPs/nip-0001.md) – NIP process and lifecycle definition

NIPs follow the naming convention `nip-XXXX.md`.  
Numbers are assigned after review and merge.

## NIP Types

To ensure clarity and classification:

- **Standard NIP:** Defines or modifies a feature of the core protocol (glyphs, grammar, logic, serialization)  
- **Informational NIP:** Provides insights, documentation, or guidance without requiring adoption  
- **Meta NIP:** Proposes changes to the NIP process or governance itself  

<br>

## NIP Status Categories

- `Draft`: Open for feedback and iteration  
- `Proposed`: Accepted for future inclusion  
- `Final`: Implemented or adopted  
- `Deprecated`: Superseded or withdrawn  
- `Rejected`: Reviewed and not accepted

|:------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------------|
| **NIP**    | Unique identifier assigned after review and merge             | 0002            |
| **Title**  | Descriptive title of the proposal                             | Example Title   |
| **Author** | GitHub handle or contributor name                             | @username       |
| **Type**   | Classification (`Standard`, `Informational`, `Meta`)          | Standard        |
| **Status** | Current state of the NIP (`Draft`, `Proposed`, etc.)          | Draft           |

| **Requires** | References to prerequisite NIPs (if any)                    | 0001            |
| **Replaces** | NIP superseded by this proposal (if any)                    | None            |


This header ensures interoperability with automated parsing, repository indexing, and future on-chain referencing.

## How to Contribute

Anyone can propose a NIP:

1. Fork this repository  
2. Create your proposal in Markdown  
3. Follow the format outlined in `nip-0001.md`  
4. Submit a pull request titled `NIP: <your title>`  

NIP editors will review, assign a number, and provide feedback.

<br>

## Governance

The NIP process is maintained by the founding author [`@augustus`](https://github.com/augustus-aligned) and early contributors.

- **Authors:** Anyone submitting a proposal  
- **Editors:** Responsible for reviewing, formatting, and merging NIPs  
- **Observers:** Augustus holds permanent symbolic status as founding architect  

Editors are appointed by the governance registry and act as neutral maintainers, ensuring procedural integrity and version control.  
This structure may evolve as the protocol matures.
