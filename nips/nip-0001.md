## TL;DR

Defines the process for proposing, discussing, and adopting changes to the Noe Protocol via NIPs. Includes workflow, status categories, types, and a template for new proposals.

<br>

## Summary

This document defines the Noe Improvement Proposal (NIP) process, the formal mechanism for proposing, discussing, and adopting changes to the Noe Protocol.

<br>

## Motivation

A transparent, community-driven process is essential for the evolution of Noe as an open symbolic communication protocol. NIPs ensure proposals are peer-reviewed, versioned, and archived for future reference.

<br>

## Specification

### What is a NIP?

A Noe Improvement Proposal (NIP) is a design document specifying a new feature, rule, glyph, grammar structure, or process within the Noe ecosystem.

### NIP Types

- **Standard:** Describes a change to the Noe protocol, symbols, grammar, or interoperability rules.
- **Informational:** Provides guidelines, general information, or design notes that do not propose a protocol change.
- **Process:** Proposes a change to the NIP process itself or other meta-level governance and procedures.

### NIP Workflow

1. **Drafting:**  
   - Anyone may propose a NIP by forking the [NIPs repository](https://github.com/Noe-Protocol/NIPs) and creating a markdown file named `nip-xxxx.md` (where `xxxx` is a provisional number or 'draft').
   - The proposal should follow the template provided below.

2. **Submission:**  
   - Submit a pull request titled `NIP: <your title>`.
   - NIP editors will review, assign a number, and suggest revisions if needed.

3. **Discussion:**  
   - Community discussion occurs via [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/Noe-Protocol/NIPs/discussions), Discord, or directly on the PR.

4. **Review & Iteration:**  
   - Editors and contributors provide feedback.
   - The author updates the NIP as needed.

5. **Status Changes:**  
   - Upon consensus, editors update the status:
     - `Draft`: Open for feedback and iteration.
     - `Proposed`: Accepted for future inclusion.
     - `Final`: Implemented or adopted.
     - `Deprecated`: Superseded or withdrawn.
     - `Rejected`: Reviewed and not accepted.


6. **Archival:**  
   - Merged NIPs are permanently archived in the repository.
